// AngularJS modules define AngularJS applications.
// AngularJS controllers control AngularJS applications.

// The "myApp" parameter refers to an HTML element in which the
//application will run. Now you can add controllers, directives,
//filters, and more, to your Angular app
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
//this is compiled AFTER the library has been loaded in script tag within head
