<b> -- Introduction </b>
<p> Sidenote: In JavaScript, all objects can be reprsented as JSON. In the client-side,
an object is created by user, and that object is sent to the midtier for further business logic.
The JSON is turned into a string using the Stringify method in JavaScript, and the data is
sent via the HTTP request body. The ObjectRep classes in Java are used for parsing the
JavaScript and creating a Java object. The midtier recieves the HTTP request, it is routed to
the appropriate method via a url defined for each in the Controller class. Spring makes
it simple to use the @Requestbody annotation to map the JSON string to the corresponding
Java ObjectRep class that we want to create. </p>
