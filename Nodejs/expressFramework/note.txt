Express is a light-weight (minimal code changes needed to integrate into current app)
NodeJs web application framework to help organize your web application into an
MVC architecture on the server-side.

The Express framework handles the low-level functionality that you would have
to otherwise write yourself with pure NodeJs. Express makes it less cumbersome to
handle routing, url parsing, etc.
