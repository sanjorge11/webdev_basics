<h1> Quick AJAX Tutorial </h1>
<p> Visit: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_ajax_intro.asp"> this link </a>
  for the W3 tutorial that I followed.
</p>


<b> -- Introduction </b>

<p> Note: This tutorial is best experienced by running it on a local server.
    For more info on XMLHttpRequest Object Methods, visit the tutorial link. </p>

<p> AJAX allows you to: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Read data from a web server after the page has loaded </li>
  <li> Update a web page without reloading the page </li>
  <li> Send data to a web server - in the background </li>
</ul>

<p> How AJAX works: </p>
<ol>
  <li> An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked) </li>
  <li> An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript in browser </li>
  <li> The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server </li>
  <li> The server processes the request </li>
  <li> The server sends a response back to the web page </li>
  <li> The response is read by JavaScript </li>
  <li> Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript - an update to DOM without reloading whole page </li>
</ol>

<div id="content">
  <h2> Send an AJAX request to change this </h2>
  <button type="button" onclick="loadDoc()"> Change Content </button>
</div>

<b> -- The XMLHttpRequest Object </b>

<p> The central part of AJAX is the XMLHttpRequest object, it is what's
    used for exchanging data with a server behind the scenes and without
    reloading the page. All modern browsers have a built-in XMLHttpRequest object.
  </p>
<p>
    Note: For security reasons, modern browsers do not allow access across domains.
    This means that both the web page and the XML file it tries to load, must
    be located on the same server.
  </p>

<hr>
<b> -- AJAX Request </b>

<p> Two examples of HTTP request methods are GET and POST. </p>

<p> GET is simpleer and faster than POST </p>

<p> You use POST requests when </p>

<ul>
  <li> A cached file is not an option (update a file or database on the server). </li>
  <li> Sending a large amount of data to the server (POST has no size limitations). </li>
  <li> Sending user input (which can contain unknown characters),
    POST is more robust and secure than GET. </li>
</ul>

<br>
<b> <u> GET Example </u> </b>

<div id="get-example-1">
  <h4> Send an AJAX request to change this </h4>
  <button type="button" onclick="requestGET1()"> Request data </button>
</div>
